# QuotesScrapper
A small python script that scraps quotes from https://content.wisestep.com/

# Usage
Run it from your terminal just like any other python program. It requires single argument - the URL from which the quotes has to be scrapped

# Example
python3 quotes.py https://content.wisestep.com/quotes-programming-coding/

It creates a file called output.json in the same directory with scrapped data.
